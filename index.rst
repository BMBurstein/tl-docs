`tl` libraries
============

About
-----

`tl` is a collection of generic C++ libraries written by `Simon Brand <https://twitter.com/TartanLlama>`_.
Some parts are backports of more recent standard library features to C++11 (e.g. :doc:`api/integer_sequence`), some are extensions of existing
standard library components (e.g. :doc:`api/optional`), others are handy utilites (e.g. :doc:`api/overload`).
